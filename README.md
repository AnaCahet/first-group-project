# Predicting US Wildfire Causes - CodeOp Group Project
### Ana Cahet & Rachel Star

## Data Sources
The data sources we have used for this project are as follows:
* US Wildfire Records 6th Edition: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behroozsohrabi/us-wildfire-records-6th-edition?select=data.csv
* US Drought Meteorological Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdminix/us-drought-meteorological-data 

We combined these datasources, and thoroughly cleaned them for our project's use.

## Our Files
* Presentation - we recommend you start here, check out our findings and final Random Forest model that we have created to predict wildfire causes within the US! Our presentation is available in both pdf and PowerPoint formats
* Working files - here we have many files, which vary from completing intial EDA and data cleaning to testing various models and finalising our Random Forest model!


## About Us
Our project was a part of our final weeks at CodeOp Data Science Bootcamp. We thoroughly enjoyed the bootcamp, and found it very exciting to put our skills into practice!
We both have LinkedIn, and we are happy to connect - please do also get in touch if you have any questions on our project!
